I will compile everything with MS Visual Studio 10 !
====================================================

>>> First step: Compile taglib to obtain tag.dll <<<
----------------------------------------------------
Preliminary: download and extract sources from https://github.com/taglib/taglib
1. Open cmd.exe and cd to taglib source directory
2. run cmake -G 'Visual Studio 10'
3. open taglib.vls, select Release and BUILD

>>> Second step: Compile chromaprint to obtain chromaprint.dll <<<
------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary: download and extract sources from https://bitbucket.org/acoustid/chromaprint
1. download pre-built DLLs and -dev versions of ffmpeg here: http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
2. generate .lib-Files on commandline and edit .def manually from the DLLs:
    dumpbin /exports "dllname.dll" > "dllname.def"
    now edit and remove dumpbin copyright output so it looks like
    
    EXPORTS
    avformat_....

    lib /def:dllname.def /out:dllname.lib /machine:x86

3. now run cmake inside the chromaprint directory and set ffmpeg include directories
   to the path of the dev version of ffmpeg. Set the library paths to point to
   the newly generated .lib files (matching the demanded library name, of course).
